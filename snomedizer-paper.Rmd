# Summary

Electronic health record systems are expanding across the world and increasingly being used for operational planning and applied research. Electronic health records largely consist of unstructured data, which present challenges to analysts and researchers. 

Solutions to these challenges lie in SNOMED CT, a global standard vocabulary for representing unstructured medical information. SNOMED CT terminology references and describes a wide range of concepts ranging from clinical anatomy to findings, procedures, and even medicines.

``snomedizer`` is an R package to interrogate Snowstorm, the open-source SNOMED CT terminology server. It is designed for non-specialists and supports operations such as: extracting attributes of a target concept; reclassifying concepts into parent concepts; building codelists; and extracting basic information from free-text information. Providing access to these operations directly from a familiar data wrangling environment will lower the barrier/threshold to the SNOMED CT ontology faced by non-expert users.

# Background 

SNOMED CT is a clinical terminology system used in 80+ countries and present in over 70% of electronic medical records systems commercialised in Europe and North America [@snomed2020; @snomedvalue2021]. Some jurisdictions now mandate its use in healthcare [@HISO10048; @SCCI0034; @DAPB4013; @DAPB4017]. 

A extensive reader on SNOMED CT is available from @Bhattacharyya2016. Briefly, SNOMED CT includes a database of healthcare terms/synonyms in several languages. But it is also an ontology made up of 'concepts', i.e real-world entities defined in relation to each other by 'relationships' (see Figure 1). Relationships express a concept's inheritance (such as being a subtype of another concept) as well as its attributes (for example, a medical disorder can have a particular anatomical finding site).

SNOMED International has developed technical specifications for terminology services [@SNOMED_SERVICE], notably the Expression Query Language [ECL, @SNOMED_ECL] which may be used to interrogate and retrieve information on concepts, their synonyms, and their relationships. Snowstorm [@snowstorm] is the official implementation of these standards into a free and open-source Java/ElasticSearch application complete with a representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface.

The present paper sets out the design of ``snomedizer``, an interface library providing access to the official SNOMED CT terminology service within the R programming environment.

# Statement of need

We considered a specific group of end users:

* healthcare analysts and health service researchers 
* with data science skills foundations
* who need to use SNOMED CT in support of wider analytical and data wrangling tasks.

The adoption of SNOMED CT in healthcare analytics is hindered by three obstacles:

1. Building on-premise terminology services and loading/updating SNOMED CT releases is complex.
2. Substantial knowledge and skill are required to query a terminology server's application programming interface (API). Users must author HTTP requests and process their response. Typical operations may require multiple (sequential) calls to the API, requiring additional programming.
3. Terminology services do not offer many hands-on training resources with real-life examples.

Typical tasks (use cases) performed by the target end users include:

- building codelists [@Dave2009; @Watson2017]
- rapidly reclassifying concepts into higher-level categories (ascendants), eg `312371005 | Acute infective bronchitis (disorder) |` to  `50417007 | Lower respiratory tract infection (disorder) |`
- extracting characteristics of a concept, for instance the `363698007 | Finding site (attribute) |` of a disorder, or the `127489000 | Has active ingredient (attribute) |` of a medical product.

# Design of snomedizer

Snowstorm [@snowstorm] already largely addresses obstacle (1) above. It enjoys a wide user base, and serves as the terminology service for many other SNOMED services (such as the SNOMED International browser). This provides welcome community support, for example when facing difficulties loading particular terminology extensions.

``snomedizer`` [@snomedizer] is intended to address obstacles (2) and (3) by providing easy functions to send and retrieve common queries to and from an existing Snowstorm terminology service.

Key requirements of ``snomedizer`` are:

* The software must not require advanced knowledge of ontological reasoning, natural language processing or software engineering.
* The software must be free and open-source.
* The software must be interoperable with popular data wrangling software used by the target user group. R is a leading leading health data science language along with Python [@Meyer2019], with a strong community (https://nhsrcommunity.com/). R use has been popularised by the data wrangling library ``dplyr`` and tidy data design principles [@Wickham2014]. 
* The software must help retrieve ascendants/descendants of one or more concepts.
* The software must help retrieve attributes of one or more concepts.
* The software must support bespoke and complex queries devised by the user.
* The software must provide extensive documentation.
* Users must be able to practice using tutorials and examples without building a Snowstorm endpoint.
* The software must warn users of potential incompatibility with the Snowstorm endpoint they choose to query.

To fulfill these requirements, ``snomedizer`` provides six wrapper functions providing user-friendly access to common operations:

* `concept_ancestors()` and `concept_descendants()` fetch active ancestors/descendants of one or more concepts
* `concept_descriptions()` fetches descriptions of one or more concepts
* `concept_find()` searches SNOMED CT concepts by term, ECL query, or concept identifiers
* `concept_included_in()` determines whether one or more concept are subtypes of a target set of concepts
* `concept_map()` maps SNOMED CT concepts to other terminology or code systems (using map reference sets).

To conform with tidy data principles [@Wickham2014], these wrapper functions return results as data frames and support vectors inputs. They also specify default options relevant to most users and trigger warnings/errors. ``snomedizer`` also includes 22 functions (prefixed with `api_*()`) providing direct implementations of relevant Snowstorm API operations (terminology authoring and maintenance operations are not supported), and a range of utility functions for handling connections to Snowstorm endpoints.

A companion website contains all documentation and tutorials (https://snomedizer.web.app/). Tutorials make use of public Snowstorm endpoints maintained by SNOMED International. These endpoints can be discovered with the `snomed_public_endpoint_suggest()` function. Their use is for reference only and subject to the SNOMED International Browser License Agreement (https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/).

HTTP requests to Snowstorm have the potential to disclose confidential personal data, for instance when containing free-text terms or rare and sensitive concepts (eg human immunodeficiency virus infections). Organisations looking to process personal information can build Snowstorm and use ``snomedizer`` on premise behind a firewall to preserve confidentiality.

Release 0.3.0 of ``snomedizer`` supports Snowstorm versions 7.6.0-7.9.3. Compatibility with future releases of Snowstorm is be monitored through a review of release notes and a range of regression tests. ``snomedizer`` releases are documented in a change log and state the latest Snowstorm release they are known to support. The package generates user warnings if the configured endpoint is not fully compatible with the current version of ``snomedizer``. Bug reports and requests for new features are encouraged and can be submitted on the package repository (https://github.com/ramses-antibiotics/snomedizer/issues/).
